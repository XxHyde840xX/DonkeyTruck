	<description>Chinese to English translation of @RedFox_2020 and @qwqwqwq's "Donkey" Box Truck. I apologize for any mistranslations as I do not speak Chinese. 
	Big thanks to the original authors for allowing me to do a translation for their awesome mod. I hope you guys enjoy their mod as much as I have.
		
	If the original authors wish at any time for me to remove this from the workshop, I will comply with their request to do so.
